## Make the Home key smarter: when Home is pressed anywhere but at the

## of the line (the left edge).

## To include most of the existing syntax definitions, you can do:

{{ else if eq .chezmoi.os "darwin" -}}
include "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/nano/*/share/nano/*.nanorc"
include "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/nano/*/share/nano/extra/*.nanorc"
{{ end -}}

## If <Tab> should always produce four spaces when editing a Python file,
